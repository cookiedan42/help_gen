  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Watch a movie. </strong>Light-hearted comedy, drama to suck you in, or an old favorite - there are countless films to whisk you away for a bit.</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Sing. </strong>It doesn't matter if you're a professional vocalist or can't to carry a tune, singing engages a completely different part of your brain. Plus, the vibrations in your chest give great sensory feedback and the vocalization reminds you of <em>your</em> <em>voice</em>.</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Watch cute videos on YouTube.</strong> About as low-effort as it gets: puppy/kitty videos, laugh challenges, or Vine compilations - take your pick.</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Mindless doodles/finger painting/playing with clay. </strong>This may be especially helpful to those with child parts (DID/OSDD) who need an activity of their own.</p>",

  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Drum on a surface. </strong>Like singing, the vibrations and bilateral stimulation of your hands thumping will engage different parts of your mind and bring your attention away from what's intruding on you.</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Play a game or use a fun app on your phone. </strong>Even if you aren't a gamer, search the app store. You might find one that speaks to you. It can be a great escape to get lost in for a bit.</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Video games. </strong>Any console, any game!</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Tear out words/photos/etc for a collage. </strong>Ask a local doctor's office or hairdresser for their spare magazines. Mindlessly rip out photos and words that speak to you. (Bonus: you may get to put tabloids to good use for once! They often have the scathing, overdramatic words that happen to be great for a therapeutic collages. Shocking! Betrayal! You Won't Believe It!).</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Discover new music. </strong>YouTube, Spotify, Pandora, so many ways to find new gems!</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Wash your face/hands or brush your teeth. </strong>A quick refresher can help you restart your day on a brand new page.</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Re-watch highlights from your favorite sport. </strong>It's easy to forget just how many epic, captivating moments there were once some time has passed. Relive your excitement. Plus, you already know how it ends, so you don't have to pay super close attention!</p>",

  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Play with a pet. </strong>Pets (when they aren't being rotten) are the best distraction!</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Listen to a podcast/audiobook.</strong></p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Try to laugh without smiling. </strong>Trust me, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KqgWfut6Ic\" target=\"_blank\">this is something you need in your life</a>.</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Color-breathing / breathing techniques. </strong>An example of color-breathing <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BI_JGSaDa0j/?taken-by=beautyafterbruises\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>",

  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Read a children\u2019s book to parts inside (OCD/OSDD). </strong>If you're struggling to stay focused, maybe young parts are who need the attention and care most.

  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Play with a tangle, fidget cube, pin art, sand tray, etc. </strong>You can do this right where you're sitting, without needing to think -- a perfect option when you're still heavily in symptoms but trying to come out.</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Count by 7\u2019s, list all the prime numbers, divide. </strong>Okay, this may be more medium-effort if math isn't your jam, but at least you don't have to go anywhere! ;)</p>",
  "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Browse art sites for images you love. </strong>Whether it's DeviantArt, flickr, Pinterest or somewhere else, sometimes soothing, fun or beautiful images can bring your mind to a brand new place.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Make an Amazon wishlist or Pinterest board of things you want.</strong> If you can't escape your current circumstances, envisioning a future time can be a nice way out.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Send texts/messages to friends to check in with them.\u00a0</strong>Concentrating on someone else can be a great way to step out of our own mind and its symptoms. Caring for others also helps us reconnect to the world at large.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Wash your makeup brushes, paint brushes or other work tools.</strong> Yeah, this one probably needed done awhile ago, too!\u00a0</p>",
  "<p><strong>Bullet journaling.\u00a0</strong>You can start any time of year, and the structure-combined-with-creativity format can provide a great detailed distraction. There are wonderful YouTube videos on how to get started or sharing ideas to help you get creative with it!</p>",

  "<p><strong>Stretch/do yoga. </strong>It's not the answer to all of a body's ails like many often suggest, but it is a phenomenal resource for trauma survivors to get into their bodies, recalibrate their autonomic nervous system through steady breathing,\u00a0and get out tensions or trapped anxieties that have been buzzing inside.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Fold laundry. </strong>A slightly mindless task, but one that still requires your attention and coordination.</p>",
  "<p><strong>List your recent accomplishments.\u00a0\u00a0</strong>You'll be amazed at just how many things you've done recently that you so easily forget without writing them down. It can be easy to recall the challenges, but the impressive and/or proud memories sometimes fall to the wayside. These can also be incredible to review at the end of a year!</p>",

  "<p><strong>Begin learning a new language. </strong>We're definitely into the higher-effort category now, but sometimes high levels of concentration and detail are needed to get someone out of the places they've been trapped in for days. A new language is a great way to shift gears entirely.</p>",
