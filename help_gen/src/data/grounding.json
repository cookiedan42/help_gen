Continue on until you feel yourself becoming more rooted in reality. Then you can start challenging the things you <em>weren\u2019t</em> really quite so sure about. (You may need a friend to help you and that\u2019s okay. If you're a Hunger Games fan, you can think of it as the <em>Real or Not Real</em> game with a loved one or parts inside.)</p>", "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Squeeze or massage your muscles. </strong>If this isn\u2019t triggering to you, deeply dig into the muscles in your shoulders and down your arms.

Notice all the new and interesting sensations you feel now that you weren\u2019t feeling before.</p>", "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>If you are frozen still, just start with very small movements.</strong> Start with just wiggling and scrunching your toes. Then try rolling your ankles. Now wiggle your fingers or tap them on a surface. Roll your wrists. Slowly work up to bending your knees and elbows. Hips and shoulders. Roll your neck. Open your mouth and stretch your jaw. Feel all the parts of your body slowly come back to life. All it takes is a small start, don't worry about the rest until you're there.</p>", "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Take a nap or get ready for bed. </strong>You may just be so overtired that you\u2019ll never be fully grounded until you get some rest.</p>", "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Fold laundry or do some other similar busywork that requires a good bit of motion but also gives you something like scent and texture to work with, too. </strong>(Who wants to be <em>fully</em> grounded for doing laundry anywayyyy ;) )</p>", "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Drink a carbonated beverage.</strong> Notice all the fizzies in your nose and down your throat.</p>", "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Disengage from anything that\u2019s too overstimulating.</strong> You may have too MANY things going on at once.

Keep yourself engaged with your surroundings but also disengage from too MUCH sensory input.</p>", "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Keep a grounding stone or similar item in your pocket when you\u2019re out and about.</strong> Run your fingers over the stone, contort a <a href=\"http://www.tanglecreations.com/pages/what-is-a-tangle\">Tangle</a> into different shapes, or notice all the notches in your car keys. Find an item like this that works well for you!</p>", "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Keep a 3x5 card attached to your sun visor in the car, or in your wallet, that clearly and boldly states what year it is, how old you are, where you live, that you are safe now, and a mantra that you may find to be soothing.</strong> Personalize it for you and your specific triggers or points of confusion - things you know you get hung up on. That way it can remind you when you aren't able to remind yourself.</p>", "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Do the same with bathroom mirrors, nightstands, bedroom walls or any other place that you know you commonly struggle.</strong> You can make them either discrete or super bold depending on your living situation or understanding of those around you.

It\u2019s one of the most fail-proof ways to get more grounded (even for those whose default coping mechanism is humor and avoidance.

One fail-proof way? <strong>Try to LAUGH WITHOUT SMILING.</strong> \u2026.you\u2019ll soon be dying over the sound that just escaped your mouth and the ridiculous face you just made trying.
