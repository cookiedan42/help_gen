  "<p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Experiment with safe touch.</strong> Use feathers, cotton, string, fingertips, light scratching, something cool, something warm. Drag them across your skin in varying places. Connect with your body and appreciate its ability to distinguish such subtle changes. Notice how different areas of the body read that stimuli differently. Try to self-soothe with the kinds of touch that you discover feel nice.</p>",
  "<p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Similarly, experiment with safe sensuality.</strong> This can be a terrifying concept for so many survivors. Becoming more comfortable with your body in a controlled, empowered way - with agency and self-love - can start to dilute so many layers of conditioned fear-response or shame. Appreciate your body as your own, no one else\u2019s; notice what it can do, feel, sense, desire - all at your direction. Recognize that it\u2019s safe, healthy, secure, and all YOURS. In time, consider opening this exploration up with a trusted partner/spouse.</p>",

  "<p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Volunteer somewhere that really speaks to your heart.</strong> Whether that is an animal shelter, soup kitchen/food pantry, after-school program, services for low-income or homeless individuals, or a charity like ours, find what really stirs in your heart and makes you feel like you\u2019re fulfilling a greater life purpose.</p>",
  "<p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Connect with a sense of spirituality if you have one or desire one.</strong> Take time to explore prayer, listen to spiritual/religious music, read books or articles, attend a service or group, etc. Carve out the time to make this possible in a meaningful way. If you have a very complicated relationship with anything spiritual or religion-based, just take the time to instead connect to the aspects of yourself that are bigger than just your thoughts/actions. Explore what makes you, you \u2014 whether that\u2019s your soul, essence, energy, spirit, or some other nebulous idea.

Whether this is done in the form of a letter, email, phone call, or face to face discussion, know your limits and then set them with others. You deserve it. You require it. And you can do this.</p>"
